2750 NE 185th Street Suite 101,305-945-0000,Miami,"Sid Koslovsky was born in the Bronx, New York in 1954. After growing up in the Bronx and then Brooklyn, he moved to Miami in 1974 when his Dad urged him to get involved in the hotel business with him. Sid managed the Bimini Bay and the Hawaiian Inn for his Dad, before becoming a partner in several real estate holdings. They included small apartment complexes in North Miami Beach, a hotel conversion in Miami Beach, and a motel known as the Malibu Motel that was converted to the Malibu Plaza in Sunny Isles Beach. In 2012 the plaza was officially sold to the City of Sunny Isles Beach, and a park was created. The Alex A. Koslovsky Family Park stands there today across from Turnberry Ocean Colony. Back in 1979 when Sid was already a partner in the hotel the All Seasons, before its conversion, Susan, Sid’s wife urged him to take a real estate course and become a fully licensed real estate agent. He did, became a Broker, and opened his own real estate firm in 1981, Koslovsky Realty, Inc. For almost 32 years the office was located in the Malibu Shopping Plaza and then in 2012 on Northeast Miami Gardens Drive. As 2020 approached Susan and Sid decided to make a change and take real estate to the next plateau. That is where Berkshire Hathaway Home Services EWM Realty came into the picture. Still wanting to stay in the neighborhood, and seeking out the premium firms around, this was the only choice to make. Sid’s forte and expertise in real estate is in knowing how to put together a deal. Whether it be residential condos, single family homes, or apartment complexes, commercial properties, or land acquisitions Sid’s history of sales and rentals has run the gamut from basic to the most luxurious. He stays involved from the first showing all the way until closing, making sure inspections, deposits, and all the documents in between are signed, sealed, and delivered. No deal is ever too small or to big to deserve his full attention. His greatest testimony is the loyalty and repeat clients that keep calling year after year, and who have been for over 40 years. In the community Sid has been an active member and leader in his synagogue, Beth Torah Benny Rok Campus, since 1982, and has led numerous charity golf tournaments for the Friends of the March of the Living, and Hillel Community Day School. As President of Oak Hammock Homeowners Association for 31 years Sid shows his pride of community and homeownership where he and his wife Susan have resided for almost 33 years. They are the proud parents of three or should we say six married children, and seven of the sweetest, and most loving grandchildren. Family is everything to Susan and Sid.",Sid,https://d2td4dobkk213c.cloudfront.net/berkshirehathawayhomeservicesewmrealty11930/profiles/11930_1776738.jpg,,Koslovsky,,305-329-4900,https://www.ewm.com/agents/1776738/Sid+Koslovsky,"{'facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/sid.koslovsky.7', 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/sid-koslovsky-a444421a5', 'instagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/sidkoslovskyrealtor/'}",FL,Broker Associate,https://sidkoslovsky.ewm.com,33180
419 West 41st Street,786-525-4621,Miami,"I originally hail from the UK and made my way to the US in 1991, where I settled in the Morningside area of Miami with my husband and son. For over 25 years, I managed our family art business, taking care of all the administrative tasks while my husband created his “faux” masterpieces. In 2004, I decided it was time to carve my own path and apply my business expertise to a career in real estate. I earned my GRI diploma to ensure I could provide the best service possible as a Realtor. This experience gave me deep insights into the real estate industry. My most recent certification, the Senior Real Estate Specialist, allows me to assist seniors facing life transitions, whether due to health issues or the loss of a partner. I go beyond simply facilitating home sales; I help seniors navigate the emotional process of sorting through decades of “memories” and belongings as they prepare for a new chapter. This aspect of my work brings me great fulfillment, as I strive to offer support beyond the transaction. Now I enjoy the Miami lifestyle in a condo with stunning views of Biscayne Bay. After nearly 30 years in a house, this shift to condo living has its advantages, especially when it comes to travel—knowing my home is secure while I’m away is a huge perk.

644 Crandon Boulevard,305-979-5844,Miami,"Hi, I’m Sara Jaramillo, and this is the story that brought me here. We’ve launched Sara Jaramillo Island Living Real Estate, and in this exciting new chapter, I’m proud to join forces with my husband and his firm, SB Studio, to offer a fully integrated experience—from identifying the perfect space to overseeing its construction and interior design. Since I was very young, I grew up surrounded by pencils, rulers, and tracing paper. I watched my father draw plans, sketch dreams, and bring them to life as real homes. His construction company, with decades of experience, has developed projects across all market segments, providing housing for thousands of families. That’s how I was raised: witnessing how stories are built and how a family’s life is transformed through the creation of a home. Drawing from my strong background in development and construction through my family’s company, I take a strategic approach to both residential and commercial real estate, always focused on delivering added value to my clients. My expertise integrates in-depth knowledge of architecture, interior design, and market dynamics, allowing me to collaborate seamlessly with design teams and ensure that every project meets the highest standards—both aesthetically and financially. I focus on aligning each property with my clients’ investment goals and long-term vision. Spaces, cities, and building dreams have always been my passion. Today, real estate is my purpose and my driving force. I’m here to build with intention, vision, and heart—and most importantly, to guide new generations in making informed decisions, choosing spaces that reflect who they are, and creating homes that inspire.",Sara,https://d2td4dobkk213c.cloudfront.net/berkshirehathawayhomeservicesewmrealty11930/profiles/11930_1972325.jpg,,Jaramillo,,305-960-5350,https://www.ewm.com/agents/1972325/Sara+Jaramillo,{},FL,Real Estate,https://sara-jaramillo.ewm.com,33149

He believes that everything is possible when it comes to matching clients with homes or buildings — retail, manufacturing, office, or multi-use. Everyone, no matter their needs or desires, meets with white-glove treatment. Rodd is unique in the South Florida real estate sector. He not only attended law school, an enormous advantage when overseeing transactions, but was the founder and CEO of his own aviation company, Hubair Inc.

He later sold the building for twice the investment. These experiences imparted lessons that inform and distinguish his real estate practice. Since 2004 Rodd has been a full-time real estate professional; well-recognized by peers for his talent in navigating the most challenging of sales circumstances and for his negotiating proficiency. His sales history earned him a place in the profession's front rank — among the top 1 percent nationally. Over the last 20 years, Rodd has listed and sold luxury and commercial properties from Miami Beach to Weston, FL. Those include: packaged bulk sales; five luxury condos, closing-out Bellini Williams Island; and five industrial properties in Hallandale Beach FL. His in-depth and broad-ranging market knowledge makes him an informed choice for any client. His listings are often featured in The Wall Street Journal, Mansion Global, The Real Deal, the Miami Herald, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, and more than 700 dot.com outlets worldwide.

2750 NE 185th Street Suite 101,917-657-3580,Miami,"Born and raised in New York. The oldest of 4 children. Born in Brooklyn and lived there till I was 14. My parents wanted a better life for us so we moved to Long Island. Fast forward a few years and then it was off to College. I graduated from Baruch College in NY and received a BBA in Finance. After College, I took the entrance boards for Law School but decided to enter the family business instead. My Father started a Women's clothing company in 1964 and I saw a good opportunity for me in lieu of Law School. Being in a family business is not easy sometimes but it taught me a lot. I learned that the customer is always right and without the customers there is no business. I learned good negotiating skills as well as analytical skills also. I worked in production and sales as well as design and fabric design and purchasing. We were in business for 48 years which I truly believe is an accomplishment within itself. I was involved in a few other businesses that were all clothing manufacturing related upon the closure of our business. knowing a few people in the real estate industry here and listening to them gave me the motivation to pursue a career in it.. I truly believe that everything I learned in my business as well as the others I was involved with is very helpful in my real estate career now.

Intimate knowledge of Miami Beach history—from its 90’s Art Deco renaissance to its current status as a sought-after destination for high-net-worth individuals worldwide—is key to Nelson’s practice. Nelson has closed on over $3 Billion in sales across a 30-year career of marketing and selling Miami Beach’s finest luxury homes – and yearly sales exceeding $150 million. Nelson is ranked #1 individual companywide for the last 4 years, and #5 individual in the Berkshire Hathaway network, globally, for 2023. There are many significant transactions brokered by Nelson. In 2021, Nelson sold the former waterfront mansion of Al Capone, twice – the first time at $10.75 million and a second time at $14.5 million. In 2019, Nelson marketed 2 adjacent North Bay Road properties offered by two separate sellers, selling to one buyer for nearly $35 million. He additionally facilitated the 2016 sale between the seller and the buyer, Ransom Everglades School, of 3551 Main Highway in Coconut Grove for $34.6 million, as well as 2015’s $33 million sale of 5800 North Bay Road to Phil Collins. Adding to his status as an industry heavyweight, Nelson’s portfolio comprises exceptional listings throughout Miami Beach’s most exclusive communities—from the Sunset Islands, Palm and Hibiscus islands to Miami Beach’s Millionaire’s Row (North Bay Road) and Pine Tree Drive.  Clients routinely return to Nelson for later transactions—drawn to his negotiating skills, uncompromising standards, and exemplary personal attention. Over the course of his decorated career, Nelson has furthermore become a trusted resource for top press outlets nationwide—regularly featured in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, New York Post, Miami Herald, The Real Deal, and Mansion Global, among countless others.
